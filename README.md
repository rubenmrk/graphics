A custom OpenGL graphics engine. Able to display text and models using blinn-phong shading. Runs on both windows and linux (wayland only). Some files are not included in this repo for licensing reasons: a slightly modified version of GLEW where I removed all dynamic library loading functions, stb image, tiny obj loader and all extra wayland protocol files (pointer-constraints-v1, relative-pointer-v1, xdg-shell). I also removed all models and textures for similar reasons.
